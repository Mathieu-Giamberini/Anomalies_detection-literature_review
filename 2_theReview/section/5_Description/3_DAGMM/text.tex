    For a continuous clustering method, \cite{BoZong.2018} propose to combine a \acr{AE} with a \acr{GMM}.
    They use the concatenation of the reconstruction error and the latten vector as the input for the \acr{GMM}
    The idea is to use the information of the latten space as information to fine-tune the anomaly score.
    For the TBM application it could maybe help the method to not raise the change of geologies as an anomaly.
    An other benefit of this method, it doesn't use the EM step, and learn the GMM classes $\pi_k$ with an MLP.
