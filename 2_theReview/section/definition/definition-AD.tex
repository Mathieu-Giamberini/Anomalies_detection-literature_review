In the context of TBM, we will define anomaly detection as the detection
of physical event that will provoke an unsolicited  degradation of a given
efficiency function. Where efficiency function is some function that converts
the machine state to a value that wants to be maximized by the user.

One can prove that this definition is a special cases of the labeling one,
by labeling the decrease of the given efficiency function and retroactively
the time series of sensors witch where influenced by the root cause event.
